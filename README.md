### Pointless python script that calculates the amount of workdays left until the provided date. 

It assumes you do not work on weekends and on holidays (Holidays are scraped from <a href="https://www.kalender.se/helgdagar">www.kalender.se</a>) and that on workdays before a holiday you only work for half the day

Run it by executing the script with python with the target date as an argument:

python3 days_of_work.py 2027-7-11
